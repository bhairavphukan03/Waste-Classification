# Waste-Classification

It is very important to segregate and classify waste in populated countries. It helps reduce the negative impacts of the environment. When hazardous waste is separated and processed separately, pollution of the air and water is greatly reduced. It is critical that waste be separated into bins so that it may be properly disposed of.

# Existing System
In India, the current garbage disposal system comprises unclassified waste collected from residences, which is then manually separated at a station. Manual sorting of solid trash can pose a number of health risks to waste sorters, as well as being inefficient, time-consuming, and not entirely possible due to the vast amount of waste.

# Proposed Model
We offer an automated waste classification system based on the Deep learning algorithms (VGG16, EfficientNet,Resnet50)  in Artificial Intelligence, where the system can identify objects in real time and classify them almost perfectly after being trained with an initial dataset. The obtained results show that automatic waste classification, using image processing and artificial intelligence methods, allows building effective systems that operate in the real world.
